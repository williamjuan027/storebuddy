## Concept

_Create digital coupons in minutes and use them in your physical stores._

What about physical business? Most are still using paper-based coupons for their promotions.

**StoreBuddy** aims to bring digital coupons to brick-and-mortar businesses. A simple solution that you can integrate to your business's operations.
